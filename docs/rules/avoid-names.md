# There is a prepared list of names for developers to avoid

Dedicated research has been performed on what namings should be avoided for the best code quality and further development experience. The idea behind this is to make the whole code coherent and readable

## Rule Details

ESLint will replace inappropriate namings with the `magicTemp` that will be easier to look up in the code. Examples of **incorrect** namings for this rule:
`foo, bar, abc, value, temp, num`
